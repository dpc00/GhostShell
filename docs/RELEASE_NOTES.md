# Release notes

## 0.1.0 (initial release)

GhostShell is a terminal for Sublime Text with profiles for shells and AI
coding CLIs, native editor scrollback, and detachable sessions. It uses
Windows ConPTY and [libghostty-vt](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty)
rather than depending on another terminal package.

- **Profiles for shells and AI coding CLIs** — launch cmd/PowerShell/WSL or
  any installed AI CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Cline, OpenCode, and others)
  in a real terminal tab, with per-profile mouse handling, alt-screen, and
  page-key routing tuned against each tool's actual behavior.
- **Detachable sessions** — a session's broker process can survive a
  Sublime Text restart and be recovered afterward, backed by a standalone
  Python interpreter and Windows Task Scheduler.
- **Native editor scrollback** — real Sublime scrollback and folding over
  terminal output, not a fixed-size alt-screen matrix.
- **Privacy-conscious defaults** — session recording (`log_tab_text`,
  `record_asciicast`) and background usage/quota scanning
  (`usage_scan_enabled`) are off by default; each is an explicit opt-in.

### Verification for this release

- Full test suite passing (624 tests, 1 intentional skip).
- Real isolated-Sublime-install smoke testing (not just unit tests) covering:
  privacy defaults taking effect at runtime, the DLL download/checksum path
  (including a real fix for a Windows ACL-related install hang), detach/
  reconnect across a simulated restart, package update, and uninstall
  behavior. See [docs/PACKAGE_CONTROL.md](PACKAGE_CONTROL.md) for the full
  dated findings.
- Not yet covered: interactive resize/selection in a real Sublime UI
  (needs a human, or a UI-driving tool this project's test harness doesn't
  have).

### Known limitations

- Windows x64 only.
- First terminal launch needs internet access to download the pinned
  native library (see [Native library](../README.md#native-library) for
  offline use).
- Not yet listed in Package Control; see
  [docs/PACKAGE_CONTROL.md](PACKAGE_CONTROL.md) for submission status.
